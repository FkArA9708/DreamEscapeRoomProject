    <h1>Welcome to DreamEscape ‚Äì Escape the world of your dreams... or nightmares</h1>
<h2>Step into DreamEscape, a unique escape room where reality and imagination blur. In this mysterious world, you're never quite sure if you're dreaming‚Äîor awake. Every detail, sound, and puzzle brings you closer to the truth‚Ä¶ and to the exit.</h2>

<p>üß† The Goal
You and your team find yourselves trapped in a dream world where time is ticking. You have 60 minutes to solve the mystery, uncover hidden clues, and make the right choices to wake up‚Äîbefore you're lost in the dream forever.

üß© How It Works
Team up: Form a group of 2 to 6 players. Teamwork is essential.

Enter the dream: Once the door closes, your adventure begins. The room is filled with riddles, hidden clues, visual illusions, and immersive soundscapes.

Solve the mystery: Everything in the room might mean something‚Äîor nothing at all. You'll need logic, communication, and sometimes pure instinct to progress.

Escape in time: You have exactly 60 minutes. Fail, and‚Ä¶ well, you'll wake up feeling a little strange.

üõ†Ô∏è About the Creator
DreamEscape was passionately designed and built by me‚Äîa fan of psychology, storytelling, and puzzles. Every element has been handcrafted, designed, and tested to create an immersive, original experience. No clich√© padlocks or puzzles you've already seen ten times, but a dream world full of surprises.</p>
